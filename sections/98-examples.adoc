== Example Calculations

* the SM3 hash function is used as stem:[H_v()], where its input is a bit string of length less than stem:[2^(64)], and its output is a hash value of length 256 bits; this algorithm is denoted as stem:[H_(256)()] in examples;

* the SM4 blockcipher is used for encryption whenever a blockcipher is necessary (only in <<example-pke>>), the block size is 128 bits, and the padding method is in accordance with PKCS#7, the mode of operation is CBC with the IV set to `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`;

* all numbers are represented in hexadecimal representation in big-endian format (the leftmost bit is the most significant bit, and the rightmost bit is the least significant bit);

* all messages provided in examples here utilize ASCII encoding.

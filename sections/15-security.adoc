== Security Considerations

* Products and services that utilize cryptography in China are
  regulated by the SCA <<SCA>>: they must be explicitly approved or
  certified by the SCA before being allowed to be sold or used in
  China.

* SM9 <<GMT-0044-2016>> is a set of cryptographic algorithms published
  by the SCA <<SCA>>. No formal proof of security is provided. The
  security properties of SM9 are under public study. There are no known
  feasible attacks against the SM9 algorithm at the time this document
  is published.

* SM9 is a set of identity-based cryptographic algorithms which depend
  on a centralized key-generation center (KGC). In use cases where
  confidentiality is paramount or trust to a central authority is
  not desired, this fact *SHOULD* be carefully considered.
